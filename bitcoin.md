### Introduction

[Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) is a ground-breaking new digital currency created by the infomous [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto), released on the 3rd of January 2009. It's praised by critics for it's low fees on transactions, infinite scalability, nation-irrelevance, and mathematically-secure form of exchange, which allows for no authoritative body or super-user. This has many advantages as it stops censorship, governmental abuse, and currency controls such as [Quantitative Easing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing).


Where traditional currencies uses methods such as Quantitative Easing, a procedure where the central bank will 'print' (electronically create) money then buy government assets to promote 'growth' in the economy, Bitcoin has an democratic culture where no central bank, no government, is physically possible to exist.
